#include <iostream>      // Library for including functions for input and output
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Library that includes all library
// Pros - No need to check anything about library
// Cons - Compilation time is more as all library are complied

using namespace std; // namespace are used to group certain functions and literals together
// std is one such namespace

int main()
{   // main function
    // complier entry point
    // int is the return type
    std::cout << "Hello World" << endl;
    cout << "Tanay Dubey" << endl;
    return 0; // every function except void has some return value
    // 0 is returned
}
